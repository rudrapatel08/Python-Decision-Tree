# Python Decision Tree
This project is a decision tree with `sklearn` on a csv of the top 500 hitters in baseball along their career. This is an example of supervidsed learning which is a branch of ML that focuses on training models that make predictions or decisions based on labeled training data.
To help me learn this I followed along with a turoial by **Ryan Nolan Data** on youtube which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkYpGhsCx4c)
